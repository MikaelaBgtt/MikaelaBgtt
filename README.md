I've joined a "free programming" mentality after left my degree in Database. But I'm searching ways to aprimorate knowledgments that I already have, although I've said that development isn't my main focus, that area was marked me since my 15 yo (good and bad memories). Now, I think that I can be more free in what I want to produce with my knowledgements, and look for a job that fits it.
